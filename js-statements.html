    <p>JavaScript Programs<br>
        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.<br>

        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.<br>

        A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.<br>

        In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.<br>

        JavaScript Statements<br>
        JavaScript statements are composed of:<br>

        Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.<br>

        This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":</p>

    <p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
    </script>


    <hr>

    <p>JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>

    <p id="semicolons"></p>

    <script>
        let a, b, c;
        a = 5;
        b = 6;
        c = a + b;
        document.getElementById("semicolons").innerHTML = c;
    </script>


    <hr>

    <p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

    <p id="Hello"></p>
    <p id="How"></p>

    <script>
        function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("Hello").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
            document.getElementById("How").innerHTML = "How are you?";
        }
